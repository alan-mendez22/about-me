         My name is Alan Mendez. I am currently and part-time student trying to complete my assoicates in web development.
         Before RVCC, I attended Lincoln Tech where I graduated from their Computer Network Support Technician program. The only programming languages I am familiar with are Java and HTMl, but I'm also taking javascript this semester in hopes that it will help me with this class.
